        We collect only the minimum data necessary for the purposes specified in
        this policy. When we request your consent to process your data, you have

        legitimate purposes and do not process it in a manner incompatible with

        - Data minimization: We limit data collection to what is necessary for
        the purposes for which it is processed.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Accuracy: We take reasonable steps to ensure personal data is accurate
        and kept up to date.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Storage limitation: We keep data in a form that permits identification
        only as long as necessary for the purposes of processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Integrity and confidentiality: We process data in a manner that
        ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized
        or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or
        damage.
